# Surveyor Project
Build it, take it, view it.

[A Ruby on Rails project from the Viking Code School which uses Active Record Associations, nested forms, collection forms, range fields, and PostgreSQL](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

This application allows users to create surveys that other users can take. The survey creators can then analyze the results of those surveys.
